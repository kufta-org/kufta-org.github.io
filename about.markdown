Hi! I'm Luke Najeeb. If you want to contact me, you can either email me, or message me @lukenajeeb:waffle.tech on Matrix! I'm based in the US, interested in coding, neuroscience, and biology.

This site is a personal site, where I'll be talking about my interests, post tutorials, and post educational content. I do hope to add on other people and work together, but that's a long way from now.
